### Goal of the Project

The objective of this project is to navigate the stages of Data Analysis by sourcing data that aligns with our interests, specifically relating to Covid-19, ensuring it is comprehensive and intricate enough to meet our requirements. We will undertake the essential data cleaning steps, followed by the application of visualization best practices and principles outlined in our lectures. The aim is to effectively communicate our findings to the audience, either supporting or refuting our initial hypotheses.

### Dataset

* What is the dataset about?
* Where did you get this dataset from (i.e., source of the dataset)?
* How big is the dataset?

**Description:**
Our dataset includes numerous statistics about the Covid-19 pandemic in Austria since its beginning. Daily number of infections, hospitalization and deaths are available among different age groups. Moreover, all of the data is aggregatable by states and disctricts. Additionally, the dataset also includes vaccine, test and available hospital beds statistics.

The source for our dataset is: https://covid19-dashboard.ages.at/. It consists of seven individual datasets of which we are going to use five for this project. However, we did also include vaccine statistics from https://www.data.gv.at/katalog/dataset/85d040af-e09a-4401-8d67-8cee3e41fcaa because it was not available via the ages covid dashboard dataset. Finally we included, demographic statistics about Austria from https://www.statistik.at/statistiken/bevoelkerung-und-soziales/bevoelkerung/bevoelkerungsstand/bevoelkerung-zu-jahres-/-quartalsanfang.

The size of our dataset in its raw form consists of six individual datasets. Combined we do have 542,507 row entries. Moreover the total of entry summarizes to 4,380,134 entries.
